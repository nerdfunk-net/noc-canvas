# Icon Encoding Fix

## Issue
The device context menu was displaying corrupted emoji characters (showing as ï¿½ question marks) for:
- "Interfaces" menu item (was: ï¿½)
- "Commands" menu item (was: ï¿½ðŸ’»)

## Root Cause
Emoji encoding corruption in the source file, likely from copy/paste or file encoding issues.

## Solution
Fixed the corrupted emoji icons in the context menu:

**File**: `frontend/src/components/NOCCanvas.vue`

- Line 1630: Changed `icon: 'ï¿½'` to `icon: 'ðŸ”Œ'` (plug emoji for Interfaces)
- Line 1639: Changed `icon: 'ï¿½ðŸ’»'` to `icon: 'ðŸ’»'` (computer emoji for Commands)

## Result
Context menu now displays correctly with proper emojis:
- ðŸ”Œ Interfaces
- ðŸ’» Commands
