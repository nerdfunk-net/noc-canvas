# Neighbor Discovery Modal Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the CDP neighbor discovery feature to display results in a visually appealing modal window instead of a basic alert dialog. The modal provides detailed information about discovered neighbors, categorizing them by status.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created NeighborDiscoveryResultModal Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/NeighborDiscoveryResultModal.vue`

A new modal component that displays neighbor discovery results with:
- **Header**: Icon, title, and subtitle showing the protocol used
- **Summary Stats**: Three-column grid showing counts for:
  - Added devices (green theme)
  - Skipped devices (yellow theme)
  - Not found devices (red theme)
- **Detailed Sections**: Scrollable content area with three color-coded sections:
  - **Added Devices**: Shows name, IP address, role, and location
  - **Skipped Devices**: Shows name, IP address, and reason for skipping
  - **Not Found Devices**: Shows neighbor names that weren't found in inventory
- **Footer**: Close button

### 2. Updated useNeighborDiscovery Composable
**File**: `frontend/src/composables/useNeighborDiscovery.ts`

Added type definitions:
```typescript
export interface NeighborDevice {
  name: string
  ipAddress?: string
  role?: string
  location?: string
  status?: string
}

export interface NeighborDiscoveryResult {
  success: boolean
  error?: string
  addedDevices: NeighborDevice[]
  skippedDevices: NeighborDevice[]
  notFoundDevices: string[]
}
```

Modified `addCdpNeighbors` function:
- Changed return type from `Promise<void>` to `Promise<NeighborDiscoveryResult | null>`
- Removed `alert()` calls
- Collects device information during discovery loop
- Returns structured data with:
  - Added devices with full details (name, IP, role, location)
  - Skipped devices with reason (already on canvas)
  - Not found devices (neighbor names only)
- Error handling returns result object with error message

### 3. Integrated Modal into NOCCanvas
**File**: `frontend/src/components/NOCCanvas.vue`

**Imports**:
- Added `NeighborDiscoveryResult` type import
- Added `NeighborDiscoveryResultModal` component import

**State Management**:
```typescript
const showNeighborDiscoveryModal = ref(false)
const neighborDiscoveryResult = ref<NeighborDiscoveryResult | null>(null)
```

**Handler Functions**:
```typescript
const handleNeighborDiscovery = async (device: Device, discoveryFn: ...) => {
  hideContextMenu()
  const result = await discoveryFn(device)
  if (result) {
    if (result.error) {
      alert(`Error: ${result.error}`)
    } else {
      neighborDiscoveryResult.value = result
      showNeighborDiscoveryModal.value = true
    }
  }
}

const closeNeighborDiscoveryModal = () => {
  showNeighborDiscoveryModal.value = false
  neighborDiscoveryResult.value = null
}
```

**Context Menu Update**:
- Changed CDP action from direct function call to use `handleNeighborDiscovery`
- Template includes modal component with proper props and event handlers

## User Experience Flow

1. User right-clicks on a device
2. Selects: Neighbors → Add → Layer2 → CDP
3. Context menu closes and discovery begins
4. If successful, modal appears showing:
   - Summary counts at the top
   - Detailed information for each category
   - Visual color coding for quick status recognition
5. User reviews results and clicks Close

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Professional-looking modal instead of plain alert()
- **More Information**: Shows device details like IP, role, location
- **Visual Organization**: Color-coded sections for easy scanning
- **Extensibility**: Pattern can be reused for other discovery protocols (MAC, OSPF, BGP, Static)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with contextual information

## Future Enhancements

The same pattern can be applied to the other neighbor discovery methods:
- `addMacNeighbors`
- `addStaticNeighbors`
- `addOspfNeighbors`
- `addBgpNeighbors`

Each would need to:
1. Change return type to `Promise<NeighborDiscoveryResult | null>`
2. Collect device information during discovery
3. Return structured data instead of showing alerts
4. Update context menu action to use `handleNeighborDiscovery`

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Open the canvas with network devices
2. Right-click on a device that has CDP neighbors
3. Navigate to: Neighbors → Add → Layer2 → CDP
4. Verify the modal appears with properly categorized results
5. Check that device details are displayed correctly
6. Confirm Close button works and modal disappears

## Technical Notes

- Modal follows the same pattern as existing modals (ConfirmDialog, LoadCanvasModal, etc.)
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent color themes
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the flow
- Composable pattern maintains separation of concerns
- Error handling preserves existing behavior (alerts for errors)
