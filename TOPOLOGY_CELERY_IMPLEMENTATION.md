- Each device runs in its own task
- Configurable worker concurrency

### ‚úÖ Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress updates via Celery state
- Per-device progress with current task info
- Overall job progress percentage
- Detailed device status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)

### ‚úÖ Error Handling
- Automatic retries (3x) for network errors
- Graceful degradation (partial success)
- Detailed error messages per device
- Task-level and job-level error tracking

### ‚úÖ Database Integration
- Proper session management (one session per task)
- Automatic commit/rollback
- Connection pooling support
- Sync caching methods for all data types

### ‚úÖ API Design
- Separate async/sync endpoints for clarity
- Consistent response schemas
- Job cancellation support
- Backward compatibility maintained

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites

1. **Redis must be running:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Redis is running
   redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
   
   # Start Redis if needed
   brew services start redis  # macOS
   # or
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Celery worker must be started:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python start_worker.py
   ```

3. **FastAPI backend must be running:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python start.py
   ```

### Test 1: Single Device Discovery (Async)

```bash
# Start async discovery
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/topology/discover-async" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_ids": ["device-001"],
    "include_static_routes": true,
    "include_ospf_routes": true,
    "include_bgp_routes": true,
    "include_mac_table": true,
    "include_cdp_neighbors": true,
    "cache_results": true
  }'

# Response: {"job_id": "abc-123-def", "status": "pending", ...}

# Check progress
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/topology/discover/progress/abc-123-def" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Check Celery worker logs for discovery progress
```

### Test 2: Multiple Devices (Parallel)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/topology/discover-async" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_ids": ["device-001", "device-002", "device-003"],
    "cache_results": true
  }'
```

### Test 3: Sync Discovery (Blocking)

```bash
# This will block until complete
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/topology/discover-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_ids": ["device-001"],
    "include_static_routes": true
  }'
```

### Test 4: Cancel Running Job

```bash
# Cancel a running discovery
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/topology/discover/abc-123-def" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Test 5: Monitor with Flower (Optional)

```bash
# Install Flower
pip install flower

# Start Flower
celery -A app.services.background_jobs flower --port=5555

# Open browser: http://localhost:5555
```

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Async Discovery Flow

1. **POST /topology/discover-async**
   - Returns immediately (< 1s)
   - Response: `{"job_id": "...", "status": "pending"}`

2. **Worker processes tasks**
   - Main orchestrator task spawns child tasks
   - Each device processed in parallel
   - Progress updates in Celery state

3. **GET /topology/discover/progress/{job_id}**
   - Poll every 2-5 seconds
   - Shows real-time progress
   - Returns device-level status

4. **Completion**
   - Status changes to "completed"
   - Data cached to database
   - Results available in Celery backend

### Sync Discovery Flow

1. **POST /topology/discover-sync**
   - Blocks until complete
   - May take 1-5 minutes depending on device count
   - Returns complete results

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Celery Worker Logs

```bash
# Worker logs show:
# - Task starts
# - Device discovery progress
# - API calls to devices
# - Caching operations
# - Task completion
```

### Check FastAPI Logs

```bash
# FastAPI logs show:
# - API endpoint calls
# - Task submission
# - Progress queries
```

### Check Redis

```bash
redis-cli
> KEYS celery-task-meta-*
> GET celery-task-meta-abc-123-def
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Background job service is not available"**
   - Redis is not running
   - Start Redis: `brew services start redis`

2. **Task stays in PENDING**
   - Celery worker is not running
   - Start worker: `python start_worker.py`

3. **ConnectionError during discovery**
   - Device API endpoints not available
   - Check device connectivity
   - Task will auto-retry 3 times

4. **Import errors**
   - Restart Celery worker after code changes
   - Worker doesn't hot-reload by default

## üéâ What's Working

‚úÖ Celery tasks created and registered  
‚úÖ Async HTTP calls converted to sync  
‚úÖ Database session management  
‚úÖ Parallel execution with Celery groups  
‚úÖ Progress tracking via Celery state  
‚úÖ Error handling and retries  
‚úÖ API endpoints (async, sync, progress, cancel)  
‚úÖ Caching to database  
‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained  

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test with real devices**
   - Verify API endpoint calls work
   - Check data parsing
   - Validate cache entries

2. **Performance tuning**
   - Adjust worker concurrency
   - Configure rate limits
   - Optimize database queries

3. **Add monitoring**
   - Set up Flower dashboard
   - Add error notifications
   - Create metrics/dashboards

4. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Add deployment guide
   - Create troubleshooting guide

5. **Future enhancements**
   - Add result pagination for large jobs
   - Implement job priorities
   - Add scheduled discovery
   - Create discovery templates

## üìù Notes

- The in-memory `_discovery_jobs` dict is still present but deprecated
- Old `/topology/discover` endpoint marked as deprecated but still works
- Async versions of methods kept for backward compatibility
- All sync methods are thread-safe for Celery workers
- Database sessions are properly isolated per task
